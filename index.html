                <h2>I'm Leojames Valerio</h2>
                <p>I am a Leojames. The first thing you should know about me is that I love the internet. I think we all need something to get us out of the mundane routine of everyday life. Something to remind us that there's a world out there beyond the confines of our homes. Something to keep us from becoming too much of the norm. Something to keep us from getting too lazy to take an interest in anything out there. The internet is just one of those things. You might be wondering why someone would spend his time playing video games, or creating content on a website for the most part. The answer to that question is really quite simple. The internet is not just a place for nerds to come together and talk about a subject. The internet is for everybody. And I am working on my blog since 2020. I am a WordPress Expert, Web Designer, Photographer and I love to play and make videogames. And I’ve been a gamer all my life. I’ve always been fond of online games, and I wanted to bring my love for photography too. photography is an amazing outlet to express your creativity through, as is gaming, in my opinion. I was fortunate to work in game development for a number of years, and while I am not looking for a full time job right now, I’ve been able to create a few different projects that I am working on currently. I plan to expand my portfolio and eventually start working on my own projects in the near future.</p>
